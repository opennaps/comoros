## Abstract {.page_break_before}




## Executive Summary

This chapter will contain a summary of the NAP containing the key priorities to be communicated.


## Framework for the NAP

### Essential functions of the NAP process:
The adaptation movement is taking a turn at the juncture of public awareness on the impacts of climate change and disaster risks, towards the formulation and 
implementation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), strategies, legislation and projects. The heterogeneity of the NAPs, due to the context-specific nature of 
adaptation suggests that different approaches are conditional on the available resources, intrinsic values, needs and perceptions within societies1. At the outset, 
adaptation planning and implementation, which are at the core of the NAP process are intended to be dynamic and iterative. The NAP is envisioned to have a 
harmonizing influence over adaptation strategies, plans and actions at different levels of government and across multiple sectors. According to the IPCC, the most 
auspicious adaptation options are ones that offer development benefits in the short term and reduce vulnerabilities in the long term. What is more, linkages between 
climate change adaptation, disaster risk management and development need to be clear to foster co-benefits against societal objectives. Equally, coordination of 
relevant stakeholders and integrated cross-sectoral approaches are integral to the NAP process, which could pose a significant challenge for Least Developed 
Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

On account of this, the Comoros, which holds its place among SIDs has constructed a roadmap for the NAP that will guide the consideration of climate risks and 
opportunities within medium and long-term plans at national and island levels and across all relevant sectors2. The NAP roadmap is split into three workstreams 
which comprise: (I) enhancing coordination mechanisms and steering the NAP process, (II) implementing the NAP process, and (III) reporting, monitoring, review and 
outreach. The creation of national and island level steering committees would further enhance the coordination of the NAP, support institutional and technical 
capacity building, improve data collection and analysis, increase knowledge and information sharing, and strengthen monitoring and evaluation processes.

Integral to the NAP was the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which agreed that improved 
adaptation actions should:

- Be undertaken in accordance with the Convention

- Follow a country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory and fully transparent approach, taking into consideration vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems

- Be based on and guided by the best available science and, as appropriate, traditional and indigenous knowledge, and by gender-sensitive approaches, with a view to 
integrate adaptation into relevant social, economic and environmental policies and actions, where appropriate

- Not be prescriptive, nor result in the duplication of efforts undertaken in-country, but rather facilitate country-owned, country-driven action

Recommended actions to promote the alignment of adaptation with national planning processes and ensure effective implementation of the NAP, include the following: (I) enhance public sensitization activities such as public information and education on climate risks; (II) streamline capacity building of media and civil society associations to improve the same; and (III) develop and maintain database systems to support the collection of climate data and socioeconomic statistical information. Improved surveyance of socio-economic benefits will reinforce public sensitization to climate risks and opportunities, and increase the local, national and island level ownership of adaptation actions.

### The NAP as the umbrella programme for adaptatio
The NAP aspires to coalesce all adaptation activities through the implementation of a coherent and coordinated approach. Practically, it would enhance 
institutional and technical capacity building, improve monitoring and evaluation of development projects and support the mobilization of climate finance.

In 2014, the Comoros jointly initiated its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process, led by the Ministry of Production, Environment, Energy, Industry and 
Handicraft (MPEEIA) and the General Commission for Planning (CGP). In the process to formulate its NAP, the Comoros established a political and strategic 
framework to ensure sustainable development, taking into consideration the impacts of climate change and the natural environment.

The Comoros’ Strategic Framework includes the following actions and plans:

- The National Environmental Policy (NEP)

- The Strategic Document for Rapid Growth and Poverty Reduction (DSCRP)

- The National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA)

- 2011-2016 Strategic Planning Framework on Natural Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction

 
- The Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D)

The role of civil society and local entities in shaping adaptation policy:

According to the NAPA and the second National Communication, the most climate vulnerable sectors in the Comoros consist of: agriculture, water resources, health, 
trade, energy, forestry and fisheries. Other vulnerable sectors include coastal systems, soils, biodiversity, infrastructure, land and tourism. The National 
Adaptation Plan Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) recalls the implementation of several initiatives in the Comoros that have contributed to knowledge and 
capacity building on the impacts of climate change including pathways to adaptation. The literature suggests that in the Comoros, civil society could take on a 
larger function in the implementation of development initiatives as traditional social structures hold prominence and a majority of municipalities have, at a 
minimum, some variant of social or cultural associations that are operational. In fact, youth movements such as the Ngo’shawo (Movement of Conscious Youth of 
Comoros), which is a well-positioned actor focuses on youth engagement and local implementation of development activities. The Comorian Consumer Federation (FCC) 
and the Union Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (UCCIA) are examples of entities that increase the agency and collective bargaining power of local 
organizations by advocating on their behalf to influence policy at the national level3. In the same way, international development actors target initiatives that 
are centered on local capacity development and ensure grassroots bodies participate in the development and monitoring of projects.

While the NAP offers numerous entry points that ensure co-benefits among development objectives, challenges in the overall process include:

- Addressing technical and human resources capacity constraints in key institutions

- Strengthening coordination mechanisms and a regulatory framework for climate change

- Increasing coordination among donors, and federal and island authorities

- Developing adequate information systems

- Improving knowledge and understanding of civil society

- Effectively mainstreaming environmental issues at island level

- Increasing data in all sectors and improving dissemination of information

Benefits of vertical integration and coordinated planning:

While renewed political stability and social peace in the Comoros has created an enabling environment, favorable to good governance in the execution of public 
affairs, the autonomy of the islands could impede coordination efforts at the national level. Political will ought to be demonstrated across all levels of 
government to ensure the vertical integration of climate change adaptation (CCA) into new and existing development planning processes and strategies, within all 
relevant sectors. Veritably, such a political standing would ensure that development gains are secured and that climate change adaptation efforts are not 
fragmented across the islands. Under different conditions, incoherent approaches to development and adaptation planning would surely stifle progress as it 
pertains to poverty reduction and improvements to food security.

### Climate change adaptation priorities identified in the Comoros’ INDC
The impacts of climate change in the Comoros are widely observed and clearly undermine development efforts that have been implemented by the government in the 
last decade. Owing to its socio-economic vulnerability and fragility, the Comoros exhibits limited adaptive capacity. Its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution (INDC) is predicated on the Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D) and numerous climate change management programs with the 
ultimate objective to contribute to poverty reduction, sustainable development and provide adequate climate change solutions.

The development of adaptation actions is based on strategies and sectoral plans affecting areas related to agriculture, energy, waste and Forests, Land Use, Land 
Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), with many land-related climate change mitigation options that have co-benefits for climate change adaptation. While the 
government of the Comoros aims to employ a mixed portfolio of measures, the challenges of ensuring sustainable development across the islands are compounded 
given the barriers and limits to adaptation. The government further recognizes the impact of climate change on the most vulnerable, chiefly rural communities and 
poor farmers who too often lack the capacity to shield themselves against the harmful impacts of climate change.

The INDC highlights four critical areas of climate change adaptation that aim to: (I) apply strict regulations to restore degraded areas; (II) promote intensive 
agriculture; (III) increase the participation of women and local communities in decision-making on matters of environmental protection; and (IV) build the 
resilience of populations in the face of climate and disaster risks. The Comoros proposes to integrate these adaptation measures into sectoral policies, as well 
as support capacity building and resource mobilization efforts.

The INDC reinforces the country’s intention to remain a carbon sink and contribute towards global decarbonization efforts. The Comoros with its status as a 
fragile country and one undergoing reconstruction and reform, has secured sustainable development gains and made progress in its adaptation efforts in the past 
two decades, yet results are fragmented and difficult to measure. A few of the adaptation constraints and challenges the Comoros faces include: (I) the lack of 
financial resources that accentuates its dependence on international support and favors a project approach against a conflation of adaptation and domestic and 
local development; (II) the limited capacity of responsible institutions to coordinate adaptation; (III) the lack of human, technical, and financial resources; 
(IV) the lack of clarity of mandates to ensure the management and protection of the natural environment; (V) the lack of an adequate regulatory framework and 
coordination mechanism among actors; (VI) a focus on response measures to emergency situations rather than prevention; (VII) the lack of baseline data; and 
(VIII) the unmet technology transfer needs for adaptation.

### Lessons from Comoros’ NAPA process: 
The NAPA provides a solid foundation for examining and communicating national adaptation plans, priorities and needs within the context of sustainable 
development and the fight against poverty.  It strives is to increase the effectiveness of the country’s development goals by focusing on thematic areas of 
interest in support of short- and medium-term climate change adaptation options. By curating a list of national adaptation initiatives and projects that reflect 
the crux of domestic political structures, socioeconomic conditions, cultural values and development challenges and opportunities, the Comoros seeks to 
strengthen its capacity to ward off the harmful effects of climate change.  

The NAPA is rooted in four clustered priority areas, which comprise: 

- An overall view of the geographic, environmental and socio-economic context of the Comoros 

- An analysis of the observed and predicted vulnerability due to climate change and climate variability; the influence of climate change and climate variability on the biophysical processes and the key sectors; and the identification of the most vulnerable groups or zones;  

- NAPA’s objective; the implementation strategy including its links with development programmes and multilateral agreements on the environment 

- A survey of adaptation options; the conditions for systematic integration of adaptation into development planning; and a methodology for ranking and prioritizing adaptation options 

In the process to formulate the NAPA, consultations that focused attention on vulnerable groups gave emphasis to the main concerns of each island. A multi-
criteria analysis, consisting of a cost-benefit analysis was used to prioritize key systems. Within the four priority areas, each of the islands cited the 
agriculture and water sectors as the most important to the population. Priorities at island level were reiterated at the national level. The distinction among 
the priorities rested on their ascribed order of importance. Priorities articulated by the population, such as poverty reduction and improvements to food 
security were given a higher ranking.  

Key adaptation options identified through the NAPA include: introduction of fish-aggregating devices, reconstruction of watersheds, restoration of soils, 
development of drought-resistant seeds, fodder production, fish conservation under ice and early warning systems, among others. While, these options respond to 
the most climate vulnerable sectors in the Comoros, which is critical to ensuring poverty reduction and improving food security, there are additional 
opportunities for alignment of adaption to national development policies that take into consideration a wider range of climate risks and address not only the 
current needs but the future vulnerabilities of Comorians. According to the IPCC, there is a propensity to underestimate the complexity of adaptation planning as 
a social process, which could inflate the capacity of adaptation planning to achieve the intended result4.  

While the NAPA is the first juncture for LDC national adaptation responses, the NAP is projected to increase the scope and influence of adaptation measures, by 
systematically linking development and adaptation agendas, policies, knowledge and risks into the medium- and long-term. Continued monitoring, evaluation and 
reporting derived from the NAPA process is vital to support the Comoros’ transition from a project-based effort to a more consolidated approach. Moreover, it is 
important to incorporate local knowledge and experience to support the formulation and integration of adaptation responses into multidimensional and multiscale 
approaches. This is based on the ability of traditional knowledge to increase adaptive capacity at the community level.

### Coherence with the national development context, SDGs, SFDRR and other relevant frameworks: 

National Development Framework 

i. Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D) 

The SCA2D is a national repository of interventions by the State and its development partners. Its objectives are to: (I) create an enabling environment that 
ensures structural transformation of the economy with a view to achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive economic growth; (II) improve the quality of life of 
the population and provide equitable access to basic social services; (III) ensure the sustainable exploitation of natural resources, while taking into account 
climate change; and (IV) strengthen good governance, build resilience, and promote the rule of law and social cohesion. The current version of the strategy 
captures the vision of the government to “make the Comoros an emerging country by 2030, respectful of human rights, gender and promoting the rule of law”. As it 
concerns the natural environment, the government seeks to establish an effective sector management system capable of meeting the needs of the population on water 
and sanitation and climate change adaptation. The strategy emphasizes the integration of climate change into national policies and strategies including those on 
ecotourism, coastal and marine systems. Adaptation actions would be carried out benefitting the most vulnerable in the water and agriculture sectors, 
particularly in urban, peri-urban and rural expanses. These adaptation actions constitute: (I) organization of information, training and communication campaigns; 
(II) promotion and effective implementation of environmental legislation and regulation; and (III) capacity building of the National Agency for Civil Aviation 
and Meteorology (ANACM), civil protection and the General Directorate of the Environment. By the same degree, enhancing agricultural policies that are geared 
towards modernization, and sustainably harnessing the natural and geopolitical potentials of the Comoros would contribute to the strategic goals of SCA2D.  

ii. 2011-2016 Strategic Planning Framework on Natural Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (CSP 2011-2016) 

A cohort of local and national planning authorities, and development partners including the UNDP on behalf of the UN System, collaborated with the Comoros in the 
process to develop and adopt the CSP 2011-2016. The strategic programming framework is structured around 3 thematic pillars within the milieu of sustainable 
development. This multidimensional and multi-year programmatic framework is primarily split into strategic parts followed by programmatic components and 
operational outcomes. The methodological approach adopted fosters effective national coordination and multisectoral coherence. As a direct result, the framework 
does not give room to fragmented sectoral approaches that intersperse internal human and budgetary resources across the national development landscape. The 
framework tackles issues related to climate change, specifically the degradation of the natural environment as well as disaster risk reduction. It focuses on 
several key areas that aim to: (I) improve the resilience of ecosystems and capacities to adapt to climate change at all levels; (II) contain the risks of 
pollution and insalubrity and to diversify the means of livelihood; (III) promote the effective implementation of innovative policies that deal with climate 
change and the loss of biological diversity, land degradation and integrated management of coastal areas;  (IV) ensure the sustainable exploitation of natural 
resources and the promotion of the ecosystem services; (V) develop systemic and institutional capacities for coordination and multisectoral management of the 
environment; and (VI) support the prevention and management of disaster and climate risks. While the framework includes actionable points organized by thematic 
pillars and a monitoring and evaluation framework, it lacks a budget and implementation plan.  

iii. Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP) 2010-2014  

The PRGSP proposed to shape the country’s development priorities from 2010-2014, while highlighting the socioeconomic conditions of the Comoros and its medium-
term macroeconomic outlook. The PRGSP presented outcomes of household survey findings taking into consideration peoples’ living conditions, along with varying 
dimensions of poverty and inequality, and provided an assessment of key socioeconomic sectors. The PRGS now serves as the reference document for the Comoros on 
socioeconomic development. On the basis of the evaluation of the PRGSP, economic activity in the Comoros has advanced auspiciously in spite of its complex 
international standing, marred by the public debt crisis. Aptly, the Comoros reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative and 
benefited from a debt cancellation of US$176 million (Stocktaking Report for the NAP Process in the Comoros, n.d.). Irrespective of the fair state of the 
environment, there is much to do in order to reverse the effects of environmental degradation. A point of import is the sustainable management of natural 
resources that contributes to subsistence for the majority of vulnerable people. Building up natural capital requires the implementation of specific measures 
devised to increase the number of protected areas and ensure the restoration of soils and the reconstitution of vegetable cover. It is generally recommended that 
such initiatives remain cost efficient, technologically sound and accessible by those most in need. This would equip subsistence farmers with alternative 
resources to sustainably manage natural resources and build their adaptive capacity. The PRGSP evaluation brings to view, the conspicuously weak capacity to 
manage projects and the rigidity of the Technical and Financial Partners (TFP) disbursement procedures. National absorption is also a challenge. Other priorities 
include, amending the mandate to ensure that the relevant bodies involved execute their roles effectively apropos of planning, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of development projects.   

iv. National Environmental Policy (1993) and the Framework Law (1994) 

The Comoros adopted a political framework that led to the development and adoption of the National Environment Policy (NEP), the Environmental Action Plan, in 
addition to the national strategy and action plan for the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. In October 1994, a legislative and regulatory 
framework was established with the adoption and promulgation of decree No 94/100/PR of the Framework Law on the Environment. The Framework Law presides over 
sustainable development, biological diversity, protection of the terrestrial and marine environment and protected areas. Whereas, the NEP was formed and adopted 
in 1993 by decree No. 93-214 / PR, centered on the "Analysis of the State of the Environment in the Comoros" document. Markedly, climate change has not been 
referenced which impels an amendment of the regulations to ensure its inclusion. According to the NAP-GSP, a series of documents have been adopted to implement 
the National Environmental Policy, these comprise: ‘The National Strategy on Biodiversity (2010)’, ‘National GEF Strategy (2007)’, and the ‘Strategy for Coastal 
Areas Integrated Management (2010)’ and its action plans.  

v. Second National Communication on Climate Change 

The conception of the second National Communication on Climate Change was predicated on national data from different sectors and thematic areas of relevance, 
including regional and global normative documents. It publicizes the need to place climate change at the center of the fight to eradicate poverty, among other 
priorities. It also spotlights the importance of strengthening adaptation efforts to maintain, at the very least, minimum standards of living for vulnerable 
people. As it happens, capacity building and implementation of adaptation measures will lead to increased costs that ought to be subsidized through international 
support. The second National Communication suggests that implementation, in principle, be grounded in a participatory approach with varying climate change 
related technical institutions and departments. Studies on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change carried out in the second National Communication covers 
four sectors, namely: health, agriculture and livestock, coastal areas and forestry/biodiversity. In the Comoros, national development plans and sectoral 
strategies do not sufficiently integrate climate change considerations. Government authorities have little understanding of the importance of climate change so 
as to strategically back initiatives, which results in a relatively low degree of prioritization of adaptation actions. Equally, funding requirements fall short 
and dedicated budget lines for climate change activities are uncommon. The quantity of climate change specialists is further limited and few training 
opportunities exist to upskill. Other constraints are demonstrated by: (I) the lack of a climate change adaptation strategy; (II) lack of coordination of the 
three post-Rio conventions; and (III) inadequate financial resources needed to implement environmental strategies and adaptation actions. 

vi. The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

The government has streamlined actions on sustainable development by aligning its policies, strategies and programs to the SDGs to ensure inclusive growth. In an 
effort to address the economic and social challenges, and meet both domestic and global commitments, the Comoros has committed to extensive structural reforms, 
at all levels. This coincides with the Comoros 2030 vision to transition to an emerging economy. Therefore, it follows that the SCA2D’s alignment with the 2030 
Agenda would complement the country’s 2030 aspiration. In 2019, the Comoros adopted a development plan for 2030 entitled Plan Comores Émergent (PCE), which has 
become a reference document for national planning and promotes the joint implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. The PCE proposes 
a set of measures: (I) promoting the prevention and management of disaster risks; (II) developing emergency response plans (nationally and in the Indian Ocean); 
(III) establishing an early warning system for natural hazards; and (IV) improving the security and protection of ecosystems.  

All in all, 68 SDG targets with affiliated indicators were prioritized, reflecting key concerns and national constraints. Concrete outcomes have also been 
achieved, specifically on climate-related priority targets: (I) SDG target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and 
natural disasters in all countries; (II) SDG target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and (III) SDG target 
13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. By 
the same token, progress has been achieved on SDG 14 with the adoption of a blue economy strategy that promotes economic and social development, and supports 
marine conservation and coastal biodiversity. Actions to promote sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems between 2015 and 2020 have ensured the 
achievement of SDG targets 15.2, 15.4 and 15.9. 

vii. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 

The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) was the initial global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts between 2005 and 2015. In post-HFA era, the Comoros’ 
was aligned to the Aqaba declaration on disaster risk reduction in cities, the Arusha Declaration and the Mauritius Declaration. The evaluation on the 
implementation of the HFA, specifically on priorities to ensure strong policies and a solid institutional framework for disaster risk reduction indicated minor 
progress. On the readiness of contingency plans and disaster preparedness plans, some progress was observed though it was devoid of the political will required. 
Following the 2nd and 3rd Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Comoros implemented a series of interventions involving: (I) revisions of the law on 
national land use planning; (II) launch of an institutional civil protection mechanism; (III) preparation of local emergency plans at the island level to build 
local resilience; (IV) establishment of a national platform for disaster risk reduction; (V) integration of disaster risk management in financial laws; and (VI) 
adoption of a national contingency plan. All things considered, the paucity of literature on- and references to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
within the national documents, policies and plans suggests a lack of alignment but admittedly an opportunity to integrate the seven Sendai targets and four 
priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks.  

viii. UNFCCC | Kyoto Protocol | Paris Agreement 

In the face of climate change, the Comorian government plans to achieve strong, inclusive and equitable economic growth without the damaging effects to the 
natural environment. In advance of the UN climate conference in Paris which subsequently launched the Paris Agreement, the Comoros submitted its climate action 
plan to the UNFCCC. The Comoros, which demonstrated its firm commitment to tackling climate change, ratified the Kyoto Protocol on April 2008. In due course, on 
April 2016 it signed the Paris Agreement, which was later ratified in November of the same year - conveying its continued commitment to dealing with climate 
change and all its impacts. The Comoros initial National Communication to the UNFCCC called attention to its climate vulnerability and flagged the country’s most 
exposed sectors. Indeed, the NAP would further enrich adaptation communications submitted to the UNFCCC in response to Article 7 of the Paris Agreement. Pursuant 
to submissions of the NAP, National Communication and the INDC to the UNFCCC, the Comoros could put forward, as appropriate, other communications or documents to 
that reflect its priorities, plans and support needs.
