<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter will contain a summary of the NAP containing the key priorities to be communicated.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-nap">Framework for the NAP</h2>
<h3 id="essential-functions-of-the-nap-process">Essential functions of the NAP process:</h3>
<p>The adaptation movement is taking a turn at the juncture of public awareness on the impacts of climate change and disaster risks, towards the formulation and
implementation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), strategies, legislation and projects. The heterogeneity of the NAPs, due to the context-specific nature of
adaptation suggests that different approaches are conditional on the available resources, intrinsic values, needs and perceptions within societies1. At the outset,
adaptation planning and implementation, which are at the core of the NAP process are intended to be dynamic and iterative. The NAP is envisioned to have a
harmonizing influence over adaptation strategies, plans and actions at different levels of government and across multiple sectors. According to the IPCC, the most
auspicious adaptation options are ones that offer development benefits in the short term and reduce vulnerabilities in the long term. What is more, linkages between
climate change adaptation, disaster risk management and development need to be clear to foster co-benefits against societal objectives. Equally, coordination of
relevant stakeholders and integrated cross-sectoral approaches are integral to the NAP process, which could pose a significant challenge for Least Developed
Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p>
<p>On account of this, the Comoros, which holds its place among SIDs has constructed a roadmap for the NAP that will guide the consideration of climate risks and
opportunities within medium and long-term plans at national and island levels and across all relevant sectors2. The NAP roadmap is split into three workstreams
which comprise: (I) enhancing coordination mechanisms and steering the NAP process, (II) implementing the NAP process, and (III) reporting, monitoring, review and
outreach. The creation of national and island level steering committees would further enhance the coordination of the NAP, support institutional and technical
capacity building, improve data collection and analysis, increase knowledge and information sharing, and strengthen monitoring and evaluation processes.</p>
<p>Integral to the NAP was the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which agreed that improved
adaptation actions should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be undertaken in accordance with the Convention</p></li>
<li><p>Follow a country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory and fully transparent approach, taking into consideration vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems</p></li>
<li><p>Be based on and guided by the best available science and, as appropriate, traditional and indigenous knowledge, and by gender-sensitive approaches, with a view to
integrate adaptation into relevant social, economic and environmental policies and actions, where appropriate</p></li>
<li><p>Not be prescriptive, nor result in the duplication of efforts undertaken in-country, but rather facilitate country-owned, country-driven action</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended actions to promote the alignment of adaptation with national planning processes and ensure effective implementation of the NAP, include the following: (I) enhance public sensitization activities such as public information and education on climate risks; (II) streamline capacity building of media and civil society associations to improve the same; and (III) develop and maintain database systems to support the collection of climate data and socioeconomic statistical information. Improved surveyance of socio-economic benefits will reinforce public sensitization to climate risks and opportunities, and increase the local, national and island level ownership of adaptation actions.</p>
<h3 id="the-nap-as-the-umbrella-programme-for-adaptatio">The NAP as the umbrella programme for adaptatio</h3>
<p>The NAP aspires to coalesce all adaptation activities through the implementation of a coherent and coordinated approach. Practically, it would enhance
institutional and technical capacity building, improve monitoring and evaluation of development projects and support the mobilization of climate finance.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Comoros jointly initiated its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process, led by the Ministry of Production, Environment, Energy, Industry and
Handicraft (MPEEIA) and the General Commission for Planning (CGP). In the process to formulate its NAP, the Comoros established a political and strategic
framework to ensure sustainable development, taking into consideration the impacts of climate change and the natural environment.</p>
<p>The Comoros’ Strategic Framework includes the following actions and plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The National Environmental Policy (NEP)</p></li>
<li><p>The Strategic Document for Rapid Growth and Poverty Reduction (DSCRP)</p></li>
<li><p>The National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA)</p></li>
<li><p>2011-2016 Strategic Planning Framework on Natural Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction</p></li>
<li><p>The Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The role of civil society and local entities in shaping adaptation policy:</p>
<p>According to the NAPA and the second National Communication, the most climate vulnerable sectors in the Comoros consist of: agriculture, water resources, health,
trade, energy, forestry and fisheries. Other vulnerable sectors include coastal systems, soils, biodiversity, infrastructure, land and tourism. The National
Adaptation Plan Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) recalls the implementation of several initiatives in the Comoros that have contributed to knowledge and
capacity building on the impacts of climate change including pathways to adaptation. The literature suggests that in the Comoros, civil society could take on a
larger function in the implementation of development initiatives as traditional social structures hold prominence and a majority of municipalities have, at a
minimum, some variant of social or cultural associations that are operational. In fact, youth movements such as the Ngo’shawo (Movement of Conscious Youth of
Comoros), which is a well-positioned actor focuses on youth engagement and local implementation of development activities. The Comorian Consumer Federation (FCC)
and the Union Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (UCCIA) are examples of entities that increase the agency and collective bargaining power of local
organizations by advocating on their behalf to influence policy at the national level3. In the same way, international development actors target initiatives that
are centered on local capacity development and ensure grassroots bodies participate in the development and monitoring of projects.</p>
<p>While the NAP offers numerous entry points that ensure co-benefits among development objectives, challenges in the overall process include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Addressing technical and human resources capacity constraints in key institutions</p></li>
<li><p>Strengthening coordination mechanisms and a regulatory framework for climate change</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing coordination among donors, and federal and island authorities</p></li>
<li><p>Developing adequate information systems</p></li>
<li><p>Improving knowledge and understanding of civil society</p></li>
<li><p>Effectively mainstreaming environmental issues at island level</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing data in all sectors and improving dissemination of information</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits of vertical integration and coordinated planning:</p>
<p>While renewed political stability and social peace in the Comoros has created an enabling environment, favorable to good governance in the execution of public
affairs, the autonomy of the islands could impede coordination efforts at the national level. Political will ought to be demonstrated across all levels of
government to ensure the vertical integration of climate change adaptation (CCA) into new and existing development planning processes and strategies, within all
relevant sectors. Veritably, such a political standing would ensure that development gains are secured and that climate change adaptation efforts are not
fragmented across the islands. Under different conditions, incoherent approaches to development and adaptation planning would surely stifle progress as it
pertains to poverty reduction and improvements to food security.</p>
<h3 id="climate-change-adaptation-priorities-identified-in-the-comoros-indc">Climate change adaptation priorities identified in the Comoros’ INDC</h3>
<p>The impacts of climate change in the Comoros are widely observed and clearly undermine development efforts that have been implemented by the government in the
last decade. Owing to its socio-economic vulnerability and fragility, the Comoros exhibits limited adaptive capacity. Its Intended Nationally Determined
Contribution (INDC) is predicated on the Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D) and numerous climate change management programs with the
ultimate objective to contribute to poverty reduction, sustainable development and provide adequate climate change solutions.</p>
<p>The development of adaptation actions is based on strategies and sectoral plans affecting areas related to agriculture, energy, waste and Forests, Land Use, Land
Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), with many land-related climate change mitigation options that have co-benefits for climate change adaptation. While the
government of the Comoros aims to employ a mixed portfolio of measures, the challenges of ensuring sustainable development across the islands are compounded
given the barriers and limits to adaptation. The government further recognizes the impact of climate change on the most vulnerable, chiefly rural communities and
poor farmers who too often lack the capacity to shield themselves against the harmful impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>The INDC highlights four critical areas of climate change adaptation that aim to: (I) apply strict regulations to restore degraded areas; (II) promote intensive
agriculture; (III) increase the participation of women and local communities in decision-making on matters of environmental protection; and (IV) build the
resilience of populations in the face of climate and disaster risks. The Comoros proposes to integrate these adaptation measures into sectoral policies, as well
as support capacity building and resource mobilization efforts.</p>
<p>The INDC reinforces the country’s intention to remain a carbon sink and contribute towards global decarbonization efforts. The Comoros with its status as a
fragile country and one undergoing reconstruction and reform, has secured sustainable development gains and made progress in its adaptation efforts in the past
two decades, yet results are fragmented and difficult to measure. A few of the adaptation constraints and challenges the Comoros faces include: (I) the lack of
financial resources that accentuates its dependence on international support and favors a project approach against a conflation of adaptation and domestic and
local development; (II) the limited capacity of responsible institutions to coordinate adaptation; (III) the lack of human, technical, and financial resources;
(IV) the lack of clarity of mandates to ensure the management and protection of the natural environment; (V) the lack of an adequate regulatory framework and
coordination mechanism among actors; (VI) a focus on response measures to emergency situations rather than prevention; (VII) the lack of baseline data; and
(VIII) the unmet technology transfer needs for adaptation.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-from-comoros-napa-process">Lessons from Comoros’ NAPA process:</h3>
<p>The NAPA provides a solid foundation for examining and communicating national adaptation plans, priorities and needs within the context of sustainable
development and the fight against poverty. It strives is to increase the effectiveness of the country’s development goals by focusing on thematic areas of
interest in support of short- and medium-term climate change adaptation options. By curating a list of national adaptation initiatives and projects that reflect
the crux of domestic political structures, socioeconomic conditions, cultural values and development challenges and opportunities, the Comoros seeks to
strengthen its capacity to ward off the harmful effects of climate change.</p>
<p>The NAPA is rooted in four clustered priority areas, which comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An overall view of the geographic, environmental and socio-economic context of the Comoros</p></li>
<li><p>An analysis of the observed and predicted vulnerability due to climate change and climate variability; the influence of climate change and climate variability on the biophysical processes and the key sectors; and the identification of the most vulnerable groups or zones;</p></li>
<li><p>NAPA’s objective; the implementation strategy including its links with development programmes and multilateral agreements on the environment</p></li>
<li><p>A survey of adaptation options; the conditions for systematic integration of adaptation into development planning; and a methodology for ranking and prioritizing adaptation options</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the process to formulate the NAPA, consultations that focused attention on vulnerable groups gave emphasis to the main concerns of each island. A multi-
criteria analysis, consisting of a cost-benefit analysis was used to prioritize key systems. Within the four priority areas, each of the islands cited the
agriculture and water sectors as the most important to the population. Priorities at island level were reiterated at the national level. The distinction among
the priorities rested on their ascribed order of importance. Priorities articulated by the population, such as poverty reduction and improvements to food
security were given a higher ranking.</p>
<p>Key adaptation options identified through the NAPA include: introduction of fish-aggregating devices, reconstruction of watersheds, restoration of soils,
development of drought-resistant seeds, fodder production, fish conservation under ice and early warning systems, among others. While, these options respond to
the most climate vulnerable sectors in the Comoros, which is critical to ensuring poverty reduction and improving food security, there are additional
opportunities for alignment of adaption to national development policies that take into consideration a wider range of climate risks and address not only the
current needs but the future vulnerabilities of Comorians. According to the IPCC, there is a propensity to underestimate the complexity of adaptation planning as
a social process, which could inflate the capacity of adaptation planning to achieve the intended result4.</p>
<p>While the NAPA is the first juncture for LDC national adaptation responses, the NAP is projected to increase the scope and influence of adaptation measures, by
systematically linking development and adaptation agendas, policies, knowledge and risks into the medium- and long-term. Continued monitoring, evaluation and
reporting derived from the NAPA process is vital to support the Comoros’ transition from a project-based effort to a more consolidated approach. Moreover, it is
important to incorporate local knowledge and experience to support the formulation and integration of adaptation responses into multidimensional and multiscale
approaches. This is based on the ability of traditional knowledge to increase adaptive capacity at the community level.</p>
<h3 id="coherence-with-the-national-development-context-sdgs-sfdrr-and-other-relevant-frameworks">Coherence with the national development context, SDGs, SFDRR and other relevant frameworks: </h3>
<p>National Development Framework</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D)</li>
</ol>
<p>The SCA2D is a national repository of interventions by the State and its development partners. Its objectives are to: (I) create an enabling environment that
ensures structural transformation of the economy with a view to achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive economic growth; (II) improve the quality of life of
the population and provide equitable access to basic social services; (III) ensure the sustainable exploitation of natural resources, while taking into account
climate change; and (IV) strengthen good governance, build resilience, and promote the rule of law and social cohesion. The current version of the strategy
captures the vision of the government to “make the Comoros an emerging country by 2030, respectful of human rights, gender and promoting the rule of law”. As it
concerns the natural environment, the government seeks to establish an effective sector management system capable of meeting the needs of the population on water
and sanitation and climate change adaptation. The strategy emphasizes the integration of climate change into national policies and strategies including those on
ecotourism, coastal and marine systems. Adaptation actions would be carried out benefitting the most vulnerable in the water and agriculture sectors,
particularly in urban, peri-urban and rural expanses. These adaptation actions constitute: (I) organization of information, training and communication campaigns;
(II) promotion and effective implementation of environmental legislation and regulation; and (III) capacity building of the National Agency for Civil Aviation
and Meteorology (ANACM), civil protection and the General Directorate of the Environment. By the same degree, enhancing agricultural policies that are geared
towards modernization, and sustainably harnessing the natural and geopolitical potentials of the Comoros would contribute to the strategic goals of SCA2D.</p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li>2011-2016 Strategic Planning Framework on Natural Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (CSP 2011-2016)</li>
</ol>
<p>A cohort of local and national planning authorities, and development partners including the UNDP on behalf of the UN System, collaborated with the Comoros in the
process to develop and adopt the CSP 2011-2016. The strategic programming framework is structured around 3 thematic pillars within the milieu of sustainable
development. This multidimensional and multi-year programmatic framework is primarily split into strategic parts followed by programmatic components and
operational outcomes. The methodological approach adopted fosters effective national coordination and multisectoral coherence. As a direct result, the framework
does not give room to fragmented sectoral approaches that intersperse internal human and budgetary resources across the national development landscape. The
framework tackles issues related to climate change, specifically the degradation of the natural environment as well as disaster risk reduction. It focuses on
several key areas that aim to: (I) improve the resilience of ecosystems and capacities to adapt to climate change at all levels; (II) contain the risks of
pollution and insalubrity and to diversify the means of livelihood; (III) promote the effective implementation of innovative policies that deal with climate
change and the loss of biological diversity, land degradation and integrated management of coastal areas; (IV) ensure the sustainable exploitation of natural
resources and the promotion of the ecosystem services; (V) develop systemic and institutional capacities for coordination and multisectoral management of the
environment; and (VI) support the prevention and management of disaster and climate risks. While the framework includes actionable points organized by thematic
pillars and a monitoring and evaluation framework, it lacks a budget and implementation plan.</p>
<ol start="3" type="i">
<li>Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP) 2010-2014</li>
</ol>
<p>The PRGSP proposed to shape the country’s development priorities from 2010-2014, while highlighting the socioeconomic conditions of the Comoros and its medium-
term macroeconomic outlook. The PRGSP presented outcomes of household survey findings taking into consideration peoples’ living conditions, along with varying
dimensions of poverty and inequality, and provided an assessment of key socioeconomic sectors. The PRGS now serves as the reference document for the Comoros on
socioeconomic development. On the basis of the evaluation of the PRGSP, economic activity in the Comoros has advanced auspiciously in spite of its complex
international standing, marred by the public debt crisis. Aptly, the Comoros reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative and
benefited from a debt cancellation of US$176 million (Stocktaking Report for the NAP Process in the Comoros, n.d.). Irrespective of the fair state of the
environment, there is much to do in order to reverse the effects of environmental degradation. A point of import is the sustainable management of natural
resources that contributes to subsistence for the majority of vulnerable people. Building up natural capital requires the implementation of specific measures
devised to increase the number of protected areas and ensure the restoration of soils and the reconstitution of vegetable cover. It is generally recommended that
such initiatives remain cost efficient, technologically sound and accessible by those most in need. This would equip subsistence farmers with alternative
resources to sustainably manage natural resources and build their adaptive capacity. The PRGSP evaluation brings to view, the conspicuously weak capacity to
manage projects and the rigidity of the Technical and Financial Partners (TFP) disbursement procedures. National absorption is also a challenge. Other priorities
include, amending the mandate to ensure that the relevant bodies involved execute their roles effectively apropos of planning, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of development projects.</p>
<ol start="4" type="i">
<li>National Environmental Policy (1993) and the Framework Law (1994)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Comoros adopted a political framework that led to the development and adoption of the National Environment Policy (NEP), the Environmental Action Plan, in
addition to the national strategy and action plan for the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. In October 1994, a legislative and regulatory
framework was established with the adoption and promulgation of decree No 94/100/PR of the Framework Law on the Environment. The Framework Law presides over
sustainable development, biological diversity, protection of the terrestrial and marine environment and protected areas. Whereas, the NEP was formed and adopted
in 1993 by decree No. 93-214 / PR, centered on the “Analysis of the State of the Environment in the Comoros” document. Markedly, climate change has not been
referenced which impels an amendment of the regulations to ensure its inclusion. According to the NAP-GSP, a series of documents have been adopted to implement
the National Environmental Policy, these comprise: ‘The National Strategy on Biodiversity (2010)’, ‘National GEF Strategy (2007)’, and the ‘Strategy for Coastal
Areas Integrated Management (2010)’ and its action plans.</p>

<li>Second National Communication on Climate Change</li>
</ol>
<p>The conception of the second National Communication on Climate Change was predicated on national data from different sectors and thematic areas of relevance,
including regional and global normative documents. It publicizes the need to place climate change at the center of the fight to eradicate poverty, among other
priorities. It also spotlights the importance of strengthening adaptation efforts to maintain, at the very least, minimum standards of living for vulnerable
people. As it happens, capacity building and implementation of adaptation measures will lead to increased costs that ought to be subsidized through international
support. The second National Communication suggests that implementation, in principle, be grounded in a participatory approach with varying climate change
related technical institutions and departments. Studies on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change carried out in the second National Communication covers
four sectors, namely: health, agriculture and livestock, coastal areas and forestry/biodiversity. In the Comoros, national development plans and sectoral
strategies do not sufficiently integrate climate change considerations. Government authorities have little understanding of the importance of climate change so
as to strategically back initiatives, which results in a relatively low degree of prioritization of adaptation actions. Equally, funding requirements fall short
and dedicated budget lines for climate change activities are uncommon. The quantity of climate change specialists is further limited and few training
opportunities exist to upskill. Other constraints are demonstrated by: (I) the lack of a climate change adaptation strategy; (II) lack of coordination of the
three post-Rio conventions; and (III) inadequate financial resources needed to implement environmental strategies and adaptation actions.</p>
<ol start="6" type="i">
<li>The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</li>
</ol>
<p>The government has streamlined actions on sustainable development by aligning its policies, strategies and programs to the SDGs to ensure inclusive growth. In an
effort to address the economic and social challenges, and meet both domestic and global commitments, the Comoros has committed to extensive structural reforms,
at all levels. This coincides with the Comoros 2030 vision to transition to an emerging economy. Therefore, it follows that the SCA2D’s alignment with the 2030
Agenda would complement the country’s 2030 aspiration. In 2019, the Comoros adopted a development plan for 2030 entitled Plan Comores Émergent (PCE), which has
become a reference document for national planning and promotes the joint implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. The PCE proposes
a set of measures: (I) promoting the prevention and management of disaster risks; (II) developing emergency response plans (nationally and in the Indian Ocean);
(III) establishing an early warning system for natural hazards; and (IV) improving the security and protection of ecosystems. </p>
<p>All in all, 68 SDG targets with affiliated indicators were prioritized, reflecting key concerns and national constraints. Concrete outcomes have also been
achieved, specifically on climate-related priority targets: (I) SDG target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and
natural disasters in all countries; (II) SDG target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and (III) SDG target
13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. By
the same token, progress has been achieved on SDG 14 with the adoption of a blue economy strategy that promotes economic and social development, and supports
marine conservation and coastal biodiversity. Actions to promote sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems between 2015 and 2020 have ensured the
achievement of SDG targets 15.2, 15.4 and 15.9.</p>
<ol start="7" type="i">
<li>Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) was the initial global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts between 2005 and 2015. In post-HFA era, the Comoros’
was aligned to the Aqaba declaration on disaster risk reduction in cities, the Arusha Declaration and the Mauritius Declaration. The evaluation on the
implementation of the HFA, specifically on priorities to ensure strong policies and a solid institutional framework for disaster risk reduction indicated minor
progress. On the readiness of contingency plans and disaster preparedness plans, some progress was observed though it was devoid of the political will required.
Following the 2nd and 3rd Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Comoros implemented a series of interventions involving: (I) revisions of the law on
national land use planning; (II) launch of an institutional civil protection mechanism; (III) preparation of local emergency plans at the island level to build
local resilience; (IV) establishment of a national platform for disaster risk reduction; (V) integration of disaster risk management in financial laws; and (VI)
adoption of a national contingency plan. All things considered, the paucity of literature on- and references to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
within the national documents, policies and plans suggests a lack of alignment but admittedly an opportunity to integrate the seven Sendai targets and four
priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks.</p>
<ol start="8" type="i">
<li>UNFCCC | Kyoto Protocol | Paris Agreement</li>
</ol>
<p>In the face of climate change, the Comorian government plans to achieve strong, inclusive and equitable economic growth without the damaging effects to the
natural environment. In advance of the UN climate conference in Paris which subsequently launched the Paris Agreement, the Comoros submitted its climate action
plan to the UNFCCC. The Comoros, which demonstrated its firm commitment to tackling climate change, ratified the Kyoto Protocol on April 2008. In due course, on
April 2016 it signed the Paris Agreement, which was later ratified in November of the same year - conveying its continued commitment to dealing with climate
change and all its impacts. The Comoros initial National Communication to the UNFCCC called attention to its climate vulnerability and flagged the country’s most
exposed sectors. Indeed, the NAP would further enrich adaptation communications submitted to the UNFCCC in response to Article 7 of the Paris Agreement. Pursuant
to submissions of the NAP, National Communication and the INDC to the UNFCCC, the Comoros could put forward, as appropriate, other communications or documents to
that reflect its priorities, plans and support needs.</p>

<h4 id="current-climate-baseline">Current Climate (Baseline)</h4>
<p>The Union of the Comoros, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, is characterized by an evolution of microclimates that is impacted by its topological relief. The
country’s weather is influenced by south and south-east trade winds from the months of April to November, which carry a relatively cool and dry tropical current
between the months of May and October. The hot and rainy season descends in the months of December to March, when the north-west monsoon prevails. The warmest
period is from November to April. The hot season is marked by humidity and frequent storms due to the tropical depressions near the archipelago or by the passage of
the intertropical convergence front. The coastal zone exhibits an average temperature of 27oC, with a maximum temperature variation between 31oC and 35oC and a
minimum of about 23oC. The cool, dry period known as the rainy season, has minimal humidity, comparatively lower temperatures and presence of winds or sea breezes.
In low altitudes the minimum average temperature ranges between 18 oC and 19oC. Annual rainfall ranges between 1000mm and 5000mm depending on the region and is
influenced by the altitude and exposure to strong winds. The Western regions of the Comoros, for instance in Grand-Comoro, the highest annual rainfall recorded is
above 4000mm at the elevation of the Karthala forest due to exposure to monsoons and a higher topological relief. Whereas, the islands of Mohéli and Anjouan exhibit
the highest range of annual rainfall between 2500mm and 4000mm.</p>
<h4 id="exposure-to-climate-impacts-and-risks">Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks</h4>
<p>The Comoros NAPA suggests that current and future climate change impacts are expected to undermine development gains, especially in the fight to eradicate poverty
and ensure socioeconomic security. Against a weak economic system, the income opportunities and prospects that ensure alternative livelihoods in response to climate
change are very limited. Climate change presents a unique challenge to the Comoros, which has to deal with the impacts and risks of climate change. The challenges
that countries face, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS), is magnified due to their small geographic territory, isolation and exposure. What is more,
development gains are threatened due to slow onset events such as sea level rise and other natural hazards including storm-surges. The country has a largely
maritime tropical weather, marked by rainfall variability, early onset and prolonged droughts, and warming- evident by a 1oC rise in the average temperature. The
trade winds and monsoon winds that can reach speeds of 100km/s in Moroni, at times exhibit a cyclonic nature, and the variance between the warmest and coolest
average temperature is in the order of 4oC.</p>
<h4 id="emerging-climate-trends">Emerging Climate Trends</h4>
<p>Given the 1960 to 1989 period, a steady reduction in rainfall was observed between 1960 and 1975. In 1976, the rainfall pattern surged, followed by strong
fluctuations for the remaining period. The intense rainfall peaks that were observed in 1976 could be attributed to El Niño, which has been increasing in
frequency and intensity in East Africa region in the last half century. According to the NAPA, these trends are predicted to continue into the future. What is
more, the frequency of cyclones and storms is predicted to intensify with increasing unpredictability. In the Comoros, 23 cyclones were reported between 1911 and
1961, 13 cyclones between 1967 and 1986 and in 2004 numerous losses in human lives and damages were reported as a result of forceful cyclones in the South West
region of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>As a result of irregular rainfall patterns, the Comoros has experienced shortened periods of the rainy season from 6 months to 3 months, with a shift to the dry
season and the persistence of drought. The variation in rainfall is also expected to alter the temporal and spatial distribution of available water resources
important for agricultural production. It therefore follows that these trends cause long-term modifications in the vegetation cover and livestock availability.</p>
<p>For the last thirty years, the warming of the Comoros has exhibited through the rise in the minimum and maximum temperatures. The 1961 to 2008 period depicted a
15% decrease in cold days and nights, and a 20% increase in hot days and nights across the country. Furthermore, warming in the order of 1oC was observed over
the 1961 to 2008 period with a variation of +/- 0.2oC per decade.</p>
<h4 id="future-climate-scenarios-projected-future-climate">Future Climate Scenarios: Projected Future Climate</h4>
<p>Although the Comoros is a carbon sink of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and only contributes minimally to emissions (2.3 teq CO2/hab/yr), it is still threatened by the
impacts of climate change. The predicted impacts that the country faces include a decrease in agriculture and fishery production, loss of biodiversity,
displacement of over 10% of the population that reside in coastal areas, contamination of groundwater sources due to saltwater intrusion and a rise in the
incidence of malaria cases6.</p>
<p>According to the IPCC, climate change scenarios for SIDS in the Indian Ocean for the 2040-2069 period indicate an increase in the annual average rainfall in the
order of 3.1% (+/– 0.45%) with a decrease in the annual average rainfall during the dry season by a range of about -2.6% to -1.8 %. With respect to annual
average temperatures, IPCC scenarios for the islands of the South West part of the Indian Ocean indicate an increase of 2.10oC in the 2040-2069 period.
Furthermore, sea level rise is predicted to reach 0.20m by 2050. Considering a 1.5oC rise in the average ocean temperature, coral whitening would cause the
damage or even death of coral reefs and lead to the reduction of marine flora and fauna, including reef fish. This would have a direct impact on deep sea fishery
resources due to declining fish populations and could lead to the loss of income for those working in the fishery sector.</p>
<p>Tourism services would be adversely affected due to damage or destruction to coral reefs. According to the NAPA, the economic valuation of tourist services with
respect to coral reefs under the jurisdiction Mohéli Marine Park is USD $3.5 million, representing 1.3% of GDP7. Ultimately, the impacts of emerging climate
trends are numerous. The Comoros is expected to endure intensified soil erosion, hotter summers, frequent droughts particularly north of the islands and
accelerated sea level rise, which would have adverse impacts on tourism, port facilities and human settlements8.</p>
<p>The Second National Communication describes the climate scenarios for the Comoros grounded on IPCC projections for future (2025, 2050 and 2100) temperature and
rainfall based on the 1961-2000 reference period. The predictive results are obtained by using the MAGICC/SCENGEN software that explores future climate change
and its uncertainties. The Special Report on Emission Scenarios has four sets of scenarios called “families”: A1, A2, B1 and B2. The A1 scenario depicts a future
of very rapid economic growth and global population that peaks mid-century and declines thereafter, given the rapid introduction of new and efficient
technologies. The A2 scenario describes a very heterogenous world, with continuously increasing global population and fragmented economic growth and
technological change. The B1 scenario, similar to A1 describes global population peaking mid-century and declining thereafter, with an emphasis on environmental
sustainability.</p>
<p>According to the Second National Communication, the warming of temperature scenarios in the Comoros, projected for the 100-year horizon between 2000 and 2100 is
grounded on the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Scenario B (low pathway): increase of 1.27oC on average (probable range: 0.16oC to 2.9oC)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Scenario A1B (intermediate pathway): increase of 1.40oC on average (range probable: 0.16oC to 2.70oC</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Scenario A2 (high pathway): increase of 1.46oC on average (probable range: 0.16oC to 3.22oC)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>By 2025, the evolution of average temperatures will lead to monthly temperature increases, the highest of which will be observed from the months of January to
April and November to December. This will translate to a rise in average temperatures between 0.61 and 0.78oC, and a decrease in average rainfall by 14% for the
month of October.</p>
<p>By 2050, rainfall is predicted to marginally increase for the months of December to April, and decrease for the remainder of the year. At the national level,
this will result in an increase in average temperature between 1.26oC and 1.47oC.</p>
<p>By 2100, warming of temperatures will intensify with a variation in average temperatures of about 1.99oC to 2.35oC. The temperature rise will be marked in the
north of the islands. Thermal variation also indicates a near doubling in temperature from 2050 to 2100. Rainfall predictions suggest a significant reduction
between the months of August and November.</p>
<p>Based on these climate scenarios, Scenario B1 shows warming of temperatures of 0.16oC in 2000 to 2.29oC in 2100, suggesting a temperature rise of 2.13oC over the
course of the century. Whereas, scenario A2 predicts a more pronounced warming of temperatures of 3.06oC.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-of-key-systems">ASSESSMENT OF KEY SYSTEMS</h3>
<h4 id="agriculture">Agriculture</h4>
<p>The Comoros’ economy is highly reliant on the agriculture sector and gives way to 66.9% of jobs for women and 51.2% of jobs for men. The primary sector employs
70% to 80% of the active population and contributes to 98% of export revenues given a limited range of cash crops. The Comoros exports crop commodities such as
vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang, which comprise 90% of the country’s total exports. At present, the Comorian export market is underdeveloped and vulnerable to
world market fluctuations. Given that agriculture production is mainly for domestic consumption, only 30% of total production is allocated for commercial
purposes. The country’s dependency on the import of food products is however increasing; currently the country imports almost 95% of its rice for consumption.
Food crop production includes bananas, tomatoes, coconuts, corn, beans, cassava, yam, taro, sweet potatoes and other tubercles. What is more, agriculture in the
Comoros only covers 40% of the food needs of the population and follows a strictly pluvial practice, one that is largely focused on subsistence but not
sufficiently mechanized. Chemical fertilizers are used sparingly, if at all, and the agricultural sector benefits rather minimally from investments.</p>
<h5 id="priority-area-development-of-crop-commodities">Priority Area: Development of Crop Commodities</h5>
<p>Agriculture represents 90% of the total land area in Anjouan, 77% of Mohéli and 61% of Grande Comore based on four farming systems, which include open field food
crop production, traditional agroforestry, cultivation in natural forests and monoculture farming. Agriculture in the Comoros is influenced by both endogenous
and exogenous constraints such as population growth that has surpassed growth in agricultural production as well as changes in local diets with a proclivity
towards imported food products. The supply chain for export crop commodities comprise vanilla, ylang-ylang and cloves. Despite its low productivity, vanilla
holds the highest value in terms of exports, comprising 43% of export production. However, vanilla production has fallen from 200 tonnes in the 1990s to 50
tonnes in 2009.</p>

<p>The Comoros is one of the leading producers of ylang-ylang, meeting an estimated 70% of global demand, however, production of the essential oil has been in long
term decline over the past 30 years. Ylang-ylang oil is a key ingredient in many fine fragrances. The Cananga Odorata crop is produced by smallholder farmers in
Anjouan and Mohéli, subsequent to which, the flowers are distilled by small distillers. Ylang-ylang oil is used in many high-end perfumeries, which makes it all
the more attractive for export production. In consideration of the export-oriented agriculture, a few limitations need to be address that involve low-tech
farming practices using rudimentary equipment for power-intensive operations such as plowing, threshing and harvesting activities. Low mechanization together
with variable technical capacities among farmers result in lower quality crop production. Ultimately, a priority for the Comoros will be to revive ylang-ylang
production and improve vanilla and clove exports by enhancing the technical and operational capacity of domestic producers in line with international quality
standards. Notwithstanding, climate change impacts such as temperature and rainfall variability, sea level rise and probable salt water intrusion in coastal
areas, could affect ylang-ylang plantations, which could lead to the loss of income for producers and affect export revenues.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-agriculture-sector">Vulnerability of the Agriculture Sector</h5>
<p>The impacts of climate change and climate variability on the biophysical process of natural ecosystems generates potential harms to the agriculture sector. It
causes the delay of fruit maturation as a consequence of prolonged droughts and high temperatures. What is more, the reproduction cycle of plant and crop
parasites and disease agents such as coconut aleurodidae (Aleurotrachelus Atratus) coincide with the crop production cycle. New parasites continue to emerge and
parasites that were previously regulated are re-emerging and at times in their most virulent forms, causing the destruction of crops. This decrease in
agricultural productivity leads to the loss of income, livelihoods and intensifies issues of food insecurity. When coupled with extensive agriculture, high costs
to access food and dependence on food imports, this renders a large segment of the population vulnerable.</p>
<p>As detailed in the Second National Communication, the key socioeconomic impacts on agriculture include: (I) prolonged droughts and water shortages, (II)
degradation of cultivable land, (III) decrease in the production of specific cultivars, (IV) increased food insecurity, (V) lower agricultural income, and (VI)
increased unemployment and precarious work, particularly among young people.</p>
<h5 id="exposure-to-climate-impacts-and-risks-1">Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks</h5>
<p>The agriculture sector in the Comoros bears threats due to climate change impacts such as thermal stresses to the environment including the warming of
temperature in extremes, including the prevalence of crop diseases caused by parasitic and disease agents, and changes in rainfall patterns and rainfall
intensity. Heavy rains, a pronounced dry season and high temperatures accelerate the degree soil erosion, land degradation and desertification, with adverse
effects to the integrity of agricultural lands. According to the NAPA, a total of 65 335 acres of agricultural lands, which represents 57.5% of the total
agriculture area, are degraded. Moreover, the North West and South East regions, which comprise eroded coast zones 1.5km to 3km long, pose flood risks from sea
level rise and experience more water shortages than all other agricultural regions in the Comoros. The country is further exposed to strong cyclones and their
subsequent destruction of crops, triggering a reduction in crop yields and causing disruption to food security. Climate impacts and subsequent risks to livestock
involve plant and cattle diseases (e.g., Newcastle disease and smallpox) that lead to livestock death, degradation of grazing pastures and health impediments to
existing cattle such as growth retardation, reduction in milk production and sensitivity to diseases.</p>
<p>[Projected Impact on the Agriculture Sector:]</p>
<p>In the Comoros, changes in rainfall will cause the reduction of river flows and waterfalls that will lead to reduced water availability required for agriculture.
To date, the country has experienced a decrease in rainfall by about 0.5mm per annum. Disruptions to the agro-climatic zones triggers a drier climate that causes
changes to local water resources. All in all, marginal variations in temperature and precipitation are causing major shifts in the water flow, particularly in
Ndzouani and Mwali. The drop in local agricultural production will affect livelihoods and dimmish purchasing power of consumers, whereas a surge in the global
demand of major crops will cause a 25% to 150% increase in the price of rice, wheat and maize by 2060.</p>

<h4 id="fisheries">Fisheries</h4>
<p>Despite a 12-mile territorial sea and 200-mile exclusive zone, fisheries in the Comoros are largely small-scale and harness around 10 000 tonnes of fish
production annually10. The fishery sector is among the key sectors in the Comoros and plays a critical role in the economy. In many ways it supports job creation
and income generation for a large segment of the society and contributes significantly to improving food security. The Second National Communication estimates
that the fishery sector provides 8,500 direct jobs for fisherman and an additional 24,000 indirect jobs in shipyards, marketing and equipment stores11. The
Comoros lacks an offshore industrial fishery and the industrial fisheries that exist are those exploited by distant fishing nations. In fact, between the 2007
and 2012 period, an estimated 22 000 tonnes of fish resources per annum were caught by fishing vessels flagged in the Comoros harvesting fish in the Economic
Exclusion Zone (EEZ)12. What is more, inland fishing is acutely rare due to the dearth of rivers, water courses and lakes and semi-industrial fishing and
aquaculture are non-existent. The totality of fishery products is marketed locally or consumed fresh. The processing of fish is minimal and limited to salt cured
fish and fish smoking as preservation methods.</p>

<p>Traditional fishing in the Comoros accounts for 40% of the dietary need in terms of animal proteins, comprising an estimated per capita consumption of 25.2 kg in
2011. The Comorian people exhibit a preference of reef fish to pelagic fish. The offshore pelagic potential amounts to 20 000 tonnes, yet only 30% of pelagic
fish have been sustainably exploited. Fish resources in the Comoros consist of offshore and coastal pelagic species, demersal species and reef species. The
demersal resources of the continental plateau, which covers 900km2, are estimated to be 450 to 1 350 tonnes per annum, while coastal pelagic resources
amount to 900 to 2 700 tonnes per annum.</p>
<p>Artisanal fishing takes places by means of small fiber glass motorized boats ranging from 6.3m to 7.1m in length. As of 2012, there were a total of 5 800 boats
across the Comorian islands, of which 30% comprised motorized fishing boats. Traditional fishing is described by the use of non-motorized wooden outrigger boats
(canoes) and account for 70% of the vessels surveyed. The national production of fish has increased from 6 000 tonnes in 1985 to 16 200 tonnes in 2004, which has
contributed to the abandonment of fresh fish imports and has amply added foreign currency to the domestic revenue base. National fishing catches are distributed
across the 3 islands of the Comoros, 60.8% from Grande Comore (Ngazidja), 29.6% from Anjouan (Ndzouani) and 9.6% from Mohéli (Mwali), 60% of which constitute two
main species, namely the skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna.</p>

<h5 id="priority-area-fish-conservation-and-preservation">Priority Area: Fish Conservation and Preservation</h5>
<p>Means of preservation extend the storage life of fish without substantially altering its natural state. Losses of catch due climate impacts such as high
temperatures in the absence of means of preservation to reduce post-harvest losses in fisheries, leads to a decrease in fisherman’s income. Therefore, proper on-
board handling of fish, for example ensuring fish are chilled and that good hygiene conditions prevail to avoid cross contamination, as well as ensuring the
physical integrity of fish to avoid bruising and damage to fish flesh and accelerated spoilage is a priority for the Comoros. Moreover, the conservation of
fisheries is critical to the ecological balance of the marine system, the social well-being of the population and the economic growth potential of the country.
In the Comoros, fishing during cyclonic periods and heavy rains leads to limited catch and a chronic deficit of fish in the market, especially for poorer
populations. Construction of conservation facilities for fish as well as selective fishing gear that avoids the capture, retention, and subsequent discarding of
immature fish and unwanted species is increasingly important for the country’s ecological sustainability.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-fishery-sector">Vulnerability of the Fishery Sector</h5>
<p>Sea level rise and shifts in coastal hydrodynamic processes could impact coastal areas by causing flooding and saltwater intrusion, while warming of temperatures
could threaten the health and integrity of coral reefs across the islands. Limited income and social protection mechanisms make it further challenging for
fishermen to invest in small-infrastructures or facilities such as cold storages or ice machines to help preserve fishery resources and reduce post-harvest
losses. Due to constraints in establishing means of preservation that extend the storage life of fish, ‘fish conservation under ice’ is among the main adaptation
priorities described in the NAPA. This would not only benefit fisherman but the entirety of local actors across the fish supply chain, including fishmongers and
local suppliers.</p>
<h5 id="exposure-to-climate-impacts-and-risks-2">Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks</h5>
<p>The worsening of climatic conditions, specifically the frequency and intensity of storms, cyclones and other extreme weather events render fishery activities
unmanageable and often result in the loss of fisherman’s income and pose adverse impacts on tourism services. Whitening of coral reefs has historically been an
issue for the Comoros. In particular in 1997, a rise in sea temperatures in the range of 1 oC to 1.5oC relative to average temperatures of 26 oC to 28 oC caused
the whitening and death of approximately 60% of coral reefs across the islands. The destruction of coral reefs also promotes the acceleration of coastal erosion
and the contraction in in the number of reef fish, including juvenile fish populations.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="water-resources">Water Resources</h4>
<p>Climate variability has led to the decline in rainfall in the country, which has severely impacted the quality and quantity of freshwater. High temperatures have
further accelerated evapotranspiration, which has contributed to the reduction in the supply of groundwater reservoirs. Surface water in Anjouan and Mohéli are
mainly supplied through river water and wells, whereas water resources in Grande Comore are primarily supplied through coastal aquifers. In the Comoros, as is
the case in a number of LDCs, the reduction of water resources influences the availability of potable water. At present, the quantity of potable water is
insufficient to meet the population’s needs. The coverage of the population with access to drinking water comprises 30% of the population of Grande-Comore, 15%
of Anjouan and 80% of Mohéli. Rainfall fluctuations, seasonal disturbances and prolonged droughts are some of the determinants of persistent water shortages,
which create issues in the implementation of basic domestic activities such as food preparation, maintenance of hygienic conditions and waste treatment.
Furthermore, the agriculture and livestock sectors are highly dependent on the availability, accessibility and quality of freshwater sources. Banana trees for
instance, are often hacked and used to water cattle, however this practice results in undernutrition and produces high susceptibility to parasitic diseases such
as theileriosis. Cases of theileriosis in cattle have led to the deaths of 20% of bovines in Grand-Comoro between 2002 and 2003.</p>
<h5 id="priority-area-extend-water-supply-and-improve-water-quality">Priority Area: Extend water supply and improve water quality</h5>
<p>Improving the water supply by strengthening water distribution networks and enhancing water quality are identified as strategic priorities in response to the
vulnerabilities of the water resources sector. Such vulnerabilities include poor water management, low supply of potable water and inadequate coastal and flood
protection measures. As local communities play an integral role in sharing local and indigenous knowledge on water resource management with a focus on
sustainability, their participation is vital to the success of adaptation projects and programs. Indeed, the construction of barrages and dams to collect and
store rainwater and the regulation of river water based on existing hydrographic networks across the three islands underpinned by an inclusive stakeholder
approach, will be critical. Ultimately, the establishment of sound watershed management is expected to support the sustainable distribution of water resources,
help visualize current land use and the varying degrees of degradation, and support the development of future scenarios against which plans can be made to
protect and improve the quality of water and other natural resources.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-water-resources-sector">Vulnerability of the Water Resources Sector</h5>
<p>The environment radiates a natural fragility and holds a limited availability of critical resources such as freshwater. There is great variability in rainfall
across the Comorian islands. The profile of Grande Comore soils exhibit high permeability. The lack of surface water also puts downward pressure on groundwater
systems required to collect and store rainwater. Water tanks are often left uncovered and are poorly maintained. Contamination of groundwater aquifers due to
exposed water tanks and saltwater encroachment along the coastal zone increase the prevalence of malaria and other vector-borne and waterborne diseases. Coastal
waters are typically brackish as a result of saltwater intrusion. Conversely, Mohéli and Anjouan are originally endowed with quasi hydrophobic soils and a dense
hydrographic network. However, river and stream flows have declined considerably over the last two decades. Previously, there were over 40 rivers to supply the
islands’ population with water. Today, fewer than 20 rivers remain and during warmer months, surface water evaporates, increasing incidences of siltation. On the
island of Grande-Comore, the freshwater supply stems from basalt tanks which requires maintenance that often falls short13.</p>
<h5 id="exposure-to-climate-impacts-and-risks-3">Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks</h5>
<p>Climate change impacts on the water resources sector have been demonstrated in myriad ways. In recent years, the groundwater has been depleted in the dry season.
In Grande-Comore sea level rise has led way to saline intrusion of coastal aquifers, which has altered the quality of freshwater with damaging effects for crop
irrigation and groundwater supplies. A survey in the 1980s revealed that after the excavating of 44 exploration wells in the coastal zone, only 24 wells
demonstrated salinity under 3g/l. Follow up evaluations undertaken in 1997 disclosed that over half of the surveyed wells were not functional and an estimated
31% displayed issues related to pumping and sewage facilities.</p>
<p>Decreased precipitation has narrowed the hydrographic network and disrupted the fragile balance between freshwater and saltwater resources. The encroachment of
seawater is particularly harmful to coastal communities that depend on the freshwater for household activities and farming practices. The risk of contamination
of freshwater is high, owing to high soil porosity and an upsurge in the concentration of sodium chloride as a result of seawater intrusion14. The loss of
freshwater vegetation could indirectly impact the dietary composition of affected populations.</p>
<p>Based on a bacteriological analysis conducted in Anjouan to test microbiological parameters of freshwater, 60% of the collected water was shown to be
contaminated. Contaminated water is also a known cause of hepatitis A and typhoid fever, which are both transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and
water, and have plagued the island for many years, causing adverse health effects and even death.</p>

<h4 id="energy">Energy</h4>
<p>According to the literature, a well-defined energy policy for the Comoros does not yet exist, however, a strategy for the diversification of energy sources is
under development. A mere 25% of Comorian households are connected to the power grid. The high cost of accessing electric power is sighted as the main barrier
for poorer households. The electricity supply is described as erratic in major towns and is essentially nonexistent in rural areas. As such, the government and
people of the Comoros are determined to pursue GHG emission reduction targets and transition to renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>The energy supply in the country is dominated by fuelwood (78%) as a result of biomass exploitation in domestic activities and for its part in powering
operations in ylang-ylang distilleries. Imported petroleum products constitute 20% for their use in electricity and transport, while butane gas (2%) represents a
small amount of the energy supplied. There is a strain on already depleted fuelwood resources and limits in terms of alternative sources of energy. In regards to
biomass, alternative plants such as oilseed plants (i.e., coconut, sesame, peanut and Jatropha Curcas) are being explored with the view to generate bioenergy.</p>
<p>Despite its hydroelectric potential, the islands of the Comoros have an estimated 1 MW of installed hydroelectric capacity16 and further studies are required to
assess the country’s full hydropower potential. The country is deficient in oil and gas reserves and it also exhibits a low potential to harness wind power.
Whereas, geothermal energy satisfies the country’s ability to meet the population’s energy demands. According to a UNEP country brief, the geothermal reservoir
on Grande Comore based on a rift system linked to active volcanos (namely the Karthala and La Grille), could be potentially tapped. Solar energy also
demonstrates great potential for expansion as the islands experience an average of 500 wh/m2 equivalent to 8hrs/day of sunshine17. What is more, numerous solar
installations exist at both domestic and commercial levels and even hotels are shifting to solar energy to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a
green economy.</p>
<p>##### Priority Area: Biomass (Exploration into fuelwood alternatives)
The energy sector in the Comoros is characterized by numerous constraints, power supply in major towns is erratic and essentially non-existent in rural areas,
for example sources of lighting in rural expanses are limited to small paraffin lamp with wicks. As a priority adaptation option among renewable energies,
biomass operates as a renewable and sustainable source of energy. Biomass fuels includes those derived from wood, charcoal, scrap lumber, forest debris, and
certain varieties of waste residues. By sustainably exploiting wood and charcoal alternatives, such as oilseed plants (i.e., coconut, sesame, peanut and Jatropha
Curcas), biomass could offer relatively cleaner fuels that could be used for cooking and heating in homes, and as a fuel alternative (e.g., ethanol) in
transportation and power generation. Biomass power plants that use biomass-derived waste to generate electricity, could in the long run contribute to carbon
neutral electricity by supporting the transition away from traditional fossil fuel usage towards an alternative energy source, which produces relatively less GHG
emissions from wood waste or other organic residuals. This in turn advances adaptation and mitigation efforts by offering an accessible, cost efficient,
renewable energy source that improves air quality in the process.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-energy-sector">Vulnerability of the Energy Sector</h5>
<p>The Comoros lacks a clear and sustainable energy policy at the national level. Policy reforms enacted in the 1990s in favor of fossil fuels that encouraged the
use of oil in lieu of fuelwood, influenced the level of emissions for that period. Specifically, biomass emissions amounted to 242 728 tonnes of CO2 in 2002
against 328 000 tonnes in 1994. Higher emissions were accounted for during that period due to the retrogression towards fossil fuels. In addition to the adverse
environmental impacts of fossil fuel usage, imported petroleum and hydrocarbons incur high costs. In 2009, the Voidjou power plant in Grande-Comore was impacted
by catastrophic disaster. The total installed power capacity fell from 18MW and currently stands at 12 MW, however only 5MW is available. The capacity factor of
power plants in Anjouan and Mohéli similarly represent under 50% of the installed capacity. The power grid is faulty which generates losses of 40% of the total
electricity production. These factors among others, are relevant to the fact that 75% of Comorian households are not connected to the power grid. Hydropower
energy production falls during the dry season when water resources diminish. Lack of funding is also a significant factor in the Comoros’ inability to fully
pursue the development of hydroelectric power. While biomass is a preferred renewable energy source for its waste reduction capacity, versatility and
accessibility, biomass from wood does not burn entirely clean and contributes to massive deforestation when not properly managed. Forest clearing, particularly
in rural areas are common due to the need of firewood and timber. This presents an opportunity for the sustainable land use management.</p>
<h5 id="exposure-to-climate-impacts-and-risks-4">Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks</h5>
<p>In consideration of the two main primary energy sources, namely biomass and hydrocarbons, the exposure to climate impacts and risks should be carefully assessed.
First, the extensive use of biomass has put a strain on already depleted fuelwood resources and if not adequately and sustainably managed could intensify current
levels of deforestation. In effect, emissions emanating from the energy sector increases with population growth and the energy needs of the transport and
industrial sectors. The very high costs of electric energy and oil have already resulted in the extensive felling of trees for firewood to meet household
consumption. Land degradation, landslides and soil erosion could further impair an already fragile natural system. As rainfall fluctuations become more
pronounced, this could directly impact biomass production. The irregular supply of groundwater, especially the depletion of freshwater reservoirs in the drier
periods, increases the vulnerability of natural and human systems. Therefore, improved water harvesting techniques and infrastructure (e.g., dams and pits) and
functional irrigation systems are critical to ensure water resource efficiency. Climate change further impacts the reproduction cycles, distribution, and
intensity of pests and diseases.</p>
<p>The Comoros’ disaster risk profile indicates that the greatest flood hazard associated with tropical cyclones occurs on Anjouan and Mohéli, while storm surges
are greatest along the southern and eastern coasts of the Comoros18. Such extreme weather events could impact the productivity of biomass feedstocks. Further to
this, the greatest absolute risk of loss from earthquakes is Grande Comore. Although infrequent, inquisitions should be made as part of a study on the potential
effects of earthquake and volcano (specifically, the Karthala and La Grille) interactions on geothermal energy production in the Comoros.</p>

<h4 id="biodiversity">Biodiversity</h4>
<p>The Comoros is an archipelago, which covers a total surface area of 2236km2, comprising four volcanic islands situated along 225km of a submarine shelf. It is
marked by its volcanic landscape, small size and insularity. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is approximately 160 000km2, with 900km2 of continental shelf and
427km of coastline19. In the Comoros, there are an estimated 2000 plant species such as the Khaya, the Comorensis, the Ocotea and the Tambourissa leptophylla on
the islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohéli. The country boasts 50 species of coral that cover 60% of the coast of Grande Comore, 80% of Anjouan and almost
100% of Mohéli. Mammal species include the Livingstone’s fruit bat, the Mongoose lemur and the Comoro rousette. Endemic bird species comprise the Karthala white-
eyes, the blue pigeon and the Karthala scops owl, among others. While endemic reptile species include the Comoro Flapnose Chameleon and the Comoro Clawless
Gecko.</p>

<p>The islands of the Comoros have an extremely narrow continental shelf of volcanic origin and subsequent poor development of coral reefs. Still, the coastal and
marine ecosystem on Grande Comore is rich and diverse including coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, tri-colored beaches, lava flows, and islets. Coral reefs
are home to key species such as the hawksbill turtle as well as mollusks, sea cucumbers and reef fish, essential for ensuring food security and coastal
livelihoods. Seaweed beds are recognized for their high productivity and abundance of fauna, they also serve as habitat for the green turtle (Chelonia Mydas) and
the dugong (Dugong Dugon). Islets are vital for seabirds and home to turtle nesting sites where marine turtles lay their eggs. Coral reef systems are
characterized as diverse, complex and among the most productive of the marine systems. Coral reefs serve as green infrastructure based on their natural coastal
protection mechanisms, absorbing between 70% to 90% of wave energy. Coastal areas of the islands are rich in biodiversity and home to endemic species including
ecosystems with significant ecological value. Further to this, Lake Dizan Boudouni covers a surface area of 30 acres in the southern part of the island of Mohéli
and is highlighted for its biodiversity of flora and fauna of great scientific interest.</p>

<h5 id="priority-area-protection-of-biodiversity-and-coastal-ecosystem">Priority Area: Protection of biodiversity and coastal ecosystem</h5>
<p>The Comoros is characterized as a biodiversity hotspot with high endemic species and key threats. Yet the potential of the biodiversity is not well understood,
which leads to weak environmental protection as well as the misuse and mismanagement of natural resources and natural habitats. The Comoros harbors the most
important eggs-laying site for marine turtles in the Indian Ocean and the 10th in the world20. It therefore follows that a key priority area for the Comoros is
the protection of marine turtles and their natural habitat along the coastal zone. Climate impacts such as sea level rise and saltwater intrusion exacerbate
coastal erosion, which when coupled with the exploitation of beach aggregates, results in the diminution in the number of sea turtles. The disappearance of sea
turtles is predicted to have an adverse effect on major economic activities related to the tourism sector, upon which it depends. The income generated from
trading beach aggregates (inert granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone) support the livelihoods of coastal inhabitants. However, the
extraction of aggregates in coastal zones has physical and environmental implications for the erosion of the coastal land. In the absence of coastal management
policies and practices, tourists that are drawn to observing nesting sea turtles in their natural habitats will likely look to other tourism destinations where
protection and conservation are prioritized.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-biodiversity-sector">Vulnerability of the Biodiversity Sector</h5>
<p>The natural environment in the Comoros is described as fragile. The area classified as a “hotspot zone” is highly endemic yet exposed to threats. Anthropogenic
effects such as the mismanagement of natural resources leads to poor protection and subsequent exploitation of natural resources. For example, population growth
and increasing poverty combined with deforestation stemming from unsustainable agricultural practices could threaten the country’s national biodiversity
heritage. Auspiciously, the adoption of the National Environmental Policy of 1993 has to some degree created an enabling environment for the protection of
biodiversity and the promotion of environmentally sustainable agricultural production. With respect to fresh waterbodies, the Grande Comore lacks permanent river
systems. The soils are composed of porous basaltic base of limited use. In effect, fragile soils are vulnerable to erosion, including gully erosion, and tectonic
instability. The low pluviometry, particularly in the eastern parts of the islands contributes to degraded soils and coastal erosion. Additionally, the lack of
monitoring mechanisms and available data on open sea marine resources intensifies vulnerabilities of the marine system. Pollution as a result of marine gasoil
from fishing vessels, and overfishing of species affect the integrity of seagrass beds, while sea turtles are contemporaneously threatened by beach degradation,
attenuation of seagrass beds and unsustainable poaching practices. Coastal and marine species, specifically immature fish and unwanted species, are also
occasionally captured, retained, and subsequently discarded. To boot, there has been a steady exploitation of local demersal resources.</p>
<p>##### Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks
The influence of climate on the biophysical process in the Comoros has been widely observed. For instance, rainfall fluctuates at varying altitudes and at
different levels of wind exposure. There are changes in average climatic conditions and seasonal discrepancies, with impacts to the hydrologic cycle, causing
rivers to dehydrate. Increases in flood risk, decreases in groundwater level and acceleration of soil erosion are also evident. With respect to the oceanographic
system, very strong currents have been observed at the western region of the island of Anjouan.</p>
<p>The impacts of climate change are predicted to reduce agriculture and fishery production, cause the loss of biodiversity, and contaminate freshwater resources,
including aquifers along the coast due to seawater encroachment and increases in the prevalence of infectious diseases such as typhoid and malaria. Saltwater
intrusion often also produces brackish water along the coast. Such impacts are expected to drive the displacement of over 10% of coastal inhabitants.</p>
<p>Anthropogenic effects of development such as overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices that involve the use of dynamite or poisonous substances, pollution
such as waste dumping and soil runoff, together with the exploitation of coral and beach aggregates continue to threaten natural systems. Coral reef systems are
at risk of destruction. It is estimated that by 2030, 60% of all coral reefs will be impacted by anthropogenic activities such as pollution as well as ocean
acidification, as a consequence of the absorption of CO221. The phenomenon of climate-induced coral bleaching due to sudden changes in ocean temperature remains
a risk. By 2050, bleaching of corals in the Comoros will result in a 90% mortality rate of coral reefs in the Comoros. Comparably, nearly all species of
mangroves are predicted to disappear by 2050 due to global temperature rise. While sea level rise is expected to destroy all the remaining mangroves that would
have survived global warming.</p>

<h4 id="tourism">Tourism</h4>
<p>The Comoros tourism sector, although in an embryonic stage of development displays strong potential for expansion. Tourism in the Comoros is described as
offering a rich biologically diverse ecosystem, with natural resources of great global and scientific interest. The tourism sector is globally acknowledged as a
climate-sensitive economic sector. Both demand and supply side stakeholders are directly impacted by climate variability and extreme weather events including
secondary effects on a broad range of natural resources that are critical for the tourism sector. Prior to 1989, tourism was predominantly driven by business
activities, missions and visits by the Comorian diaspora. However, since the opening of hotel Galawa in 1989, tourism in the Comoros has taken a shift towards
leisure. Although, since 2000 the number of incoming tourists has plummeted, from 27 474 tourists in 1998 to 18 900 tourists in 2003. Compared to other island
destinations in Africa such as Mauritius and the Seychelles, the hotel occupancy rate in the Comoros is exponentially lower. What is more, quality of standard
and comfort is not consistently upheld. Despite the 600 personnel employed in hospitality services, a majority of hotel establishments are in fact managed by
nonprofessionals and poorly trained hotel staff. Under current conditions, the Comoros tourism industry is confronted by a number of challenges that will
influence its long-term development and success, among these include climate change and sustainability, human resources, and productivity and competitiveness23.</p>
<p>##### Priority Area: Ecotourism<br />
Promotion of the Mohéli marine park would help develop ecotourism in the archipelago, providing effective economic incentives to support conservation and improve
the bio-cultural diversity and protect the natural and cultural heritage of the country. The marine park would serve as a marine protected area to safeguard a
section of the ocean by imposing limits on human activity. In regards to the economic value of tourist services such as the coral reefs, the Mohéli Marine Park
is an estimated 1.2 billion Comorian Francs equivalent to USD $3.5 million. Further to the promotion of the marine park, national tourist services in the Comoros
need to be improved. Currently, there are insufficient tourist services and hotel accommodation capacity is limited. Improvements in terms of basic hotel
infrastructure, education and training of hotel personnel and tourism-related workers, and enhancements with respect to public information on tourism information
resources is required.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-tourism-sector">Vulnerability of the Tourism Sector</h5>
<p>The tourism sector in the Comoros is underexploited and according to the Second National Communication, tourism and hospitality services are inadequate and
accommodation capacities are quite limited. For instance, there are less than 500 beds with an annual occupancy rate of under 40%. Education and skills
development are also critical for tourism destination countries and a persistent challenge in LDCs. In order to meet tourism growth, the Comoros will need to
focus on service quality standards both physically via hospitality and accommodation services, and virtually by means of expedient tourism information resources
websites.</p>
<p>Sand mining of beaches accelerates coastal erosion and is expected to negatively affect the future development of tourism. The national economy and the
livelihoods of coastal communities is largely provisional on the tourism and fishery sectors. The disappearance of sea turtles is also predicted to have an
adverse effect on major economic activities related to the tourism sector.</p>
<p>##### Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks
The Comoros is expected to endure intensified soil erosion, hotter summers, frequent droughts particularly north of the islands and accelerated sea level rise,
which would have adverse impacts on tourism, port facilities and human settlements24. These climate trends are predicted to cause changes to the country’s
vegetation cover, with consequences to the subsistence of certain plant and animal species and cause the destruction of natural habitats. According to the
literature, several beaches namely those in Itsandra, Mitsamihouli, Maloudja, Chomoni and those belonging to the islands of Nioumachoua, Moya, Ouani and Mirontsi
are expected to disappear due to sea level rise. Based on economic projections, the loss of tourism revenue associated with the disappearance of beaches is
estimated to be reach the current value 40 billion Comorian Francs by 205025.</p>
<p>Floods and cyclones are expected to cause major damage to dwellings, property and critical infrastructure, as well as affect inhabitants and destroy crops.
Damages to hotels and tourist centers, including roads, airport facilities and water and sewage systems could directly undermine the tourism sector. In the
absence of coastal management policies and practices, tourists that are drawn to observing nesting sea turtles in their natural habitats will likely look to
other tourism destinations where protection and conservation measures are prioritized. Coral bleaching and the subsequent destruction of coral reefs as a result
of climate change will not only impact the livelihoods of coastal communities and put pressure on food security, but also destabilize an economy that is highly
dependent on the growth of the tourism sector.</p>

<h4 id="disaster-risk-management">Disaster Risk Management</h4>
<p>Disaster risk reduction is still a nascent area of work in the Comoros. According to the NAPA, disaster risk management and coordination mechanisms are still
under development and en route to being operationalized. In the country, disaster risks are closely associated with climate change risks and impacts. A segment
of Comoros’ INDC that focuses on risk management includes priorities such as capacity building of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), development of risk
assessments, awareness raising to improve the understanding of disaster risks, and preparation of civil society on disaster risk management. According to the
2020 human development indicators for the Comoros, a mere 29.2% of Comoros’ population reside in urban areas29. Analysis indicates that on average, the Comoros
has around USD $5.7 million in combined direct losses from earthquakes, floods and tropical cyclones every year30. Tropical cyclones pose the most significant
risk of the three hazards, producing an estimated 64% of the average loss per annum. Cyclones such as the one that took place in 1950, claimed 524 lives on the
island of Grande Comore and equivalent losses were recorded on the other islands. Beyond this, seven severe cyclones and storm surges occurred between 1986 and
1999 in the Comoros.</p>

<p>In order to be successful, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies require public interest, leadership, and acceptance31. The IPCC
suggests that based on the knowledge of disaster risk research and findings, the condition for understanding climate risks and extreme events involves knowledge
of different key elements. These include, understanding the exposure within its spatial and temporal dimensions, recognizing drivers of vulnerability, and ways
in which climate change influences hazards. Key for the Comoros will be the development of technical capacities and measures that include Geographic Information
System (GIS), Early Warning Systems (EWS), disaster risk assessments and risk communication between decisionmakers and local inhabitants. Risk communication
failures experienced in other countries suggest that trust in official institutions responsible for early warning and disaster management in the Comoros is vital
for reducing disaster risks. Moreover, it is important to engage different stakeholders to process the existing or impending challenges and identify respective
solutions.</p>
<h5 id="vulnerability-of-the-disaster-risk-management-system">Vulnerability of the Disaster Risk Management System</h5>
<p>There are numerous disaster risks in the country, which involve volcanic eruptions in Grande Comore, as well as tropical cyclones, floods and to a lesser extent,
tsunamis. Eruptions of the Karthala volcano on Grand Comore have, on three occasions, resulted in the evacuation of many towns situated on the slopes of the
mountain. Other disasters on Grande Comore based on anthropogenic hazards include the Voidjou power plant disaster in September 2009, characterized as one of the
worst disasters of its time. In general, the Comoros’ status an LDC and SIDS renders it highly vulnerable to climate change impacts and extreme weather.
According to literature, the Comoros displays a vulnerability rate of 82.1% based on the 2011 Human Development Report, which indicates the country’s high level
of exposure to numerous natural risks and threats.</p>
<p>The increase in intensity and frequency of extreme weather and slow onset events such as floods and droughts, exacerbate vulnerability to infectious diseases,
trigger disasters and destruction of natural resources, and perpetuate socioeconomic problems associated with daily life. Forced migration and displacement due
to extreme weather would be difficult to control. Weather-related disasters in the Comoros deprive households of secure dwellings, and cause the destruction of
pastures and meadows which disrupt farmers’ means of agricultural production and subsistence. Loss of productivity in sectors such as commerce, energy and
transport, together with secondary effects in all other economic sectors limit future investments and put downward pressure on consumption, ultimately lowering
GDP. Increased vulnerability in the absence of social protection mechanisms suggests insufficient means and opportunities to recover from climate and disaster
related shocks. The combination of the status of socioeconomic development in the country, coupled with climate sensitive resources such as water, forests and
soils, and the level of development of critical infrastructure, is too precarious to reasonably offset the effects of climate change and climate variability.</p>
<h5 id="exposure-to-climate-impacts-and-risks-5">Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks</h5>
<p>Earthquakes, floods and tropical cyclones comprise the three most common hazards in the Comoros. Other natural hazards include landslides, wind, storm surges,
excessive rainfall and earthquakes. Anjouan incurs the highest economic losses of the three islands, amounting to 80% of the average annual losses from all three
hazards across the archipelago. The greatest wind hazard is in the northeast and southeast of Anjouan. The greatest flood hazard due to tropical cyclones is in
Anjouan and Mohéli. While the greatest storm hazard runs along the southern and eastern coasts of the Comoros. The residential sector is generally the hardest
hit and experiences 80% of the combined losses, followed by 11% of losses in the public sector and 6% in the commercial sector32. Direct losses total USD $5.7
million from earthquakes, floods and tropical cyclones every year. The losses of human lives are linked to the resurgence of infectious diseases. Climate risk
associated with seasonal drought is expected to lead to 34% loss of human life, while cyclonic events are predicted to cause a 24% loss in human life33.</p>
<p>Further to this, the 100-year return period loss from earthquakes, floods and cyclones totals over $48 million which is equivalent to about 8% of the Comoros’
GDP in 2014. The assessed total replacement value in 2015 for all residential, industrial and public buildings and other infrastructure was reported to be nearly
USD $2.6 billion. The island of Grande Comore exhibits the largest concentration of replacement value. With respect to occupancy type, the residential sector
reports above 66% of the toral replacement value34.</p>

<h4 id="waste-and-sanitation">Waste and Sanitation</h4>
<p>The anarchic development of urban centers marked by informal housing and spontaneous districts has increased risks of pollution in the country. There are no
sustainable waste management solutions in the Comoros, which is a significant cause for concern as open burning of household waste is common and largely
uncontrolled. The Second National Communication highlights that inadequate waste management and cleaning systems increase the prevalence of infectious diseases
such as malaria and typhoid, and present potential risk of contamination of groundwater reservoirs and damage to coral reef systems. The deterioration of coral
reefs results from exposure of the reefs to unsustainable fishing practices such as the use of dynamite, uncontrolled anchoring of ships, treading at low tide,
waste dumping and soil runoff35. Anthropogenic hazards coupled with climate variability, magnifies the effects of coral bleaching, which is caused by the
precipitous warming of ocean temperatures. In the Comoros, waste is scattered along the coastal zone and in the vicinity of townships and metropolitan areas. The
lack of a drainage and waste management system also signals that wastewater flows directly into the ocean. Water distribution infrastructure needs to be
adequately developed and managed, water tanks need to be covered to reduce the risk of vector-borne diseases, and the treatment and disposal of municipal,
industrial and other solid waste should be prioritized.</p>
<h5 id="priority-area-improve-urban-waste-management-system">Priority Area: Improve urban waste management system</h5>
<p>Population growth, expressly in urban areas, and the lack of waste management causes the indiscriminate dumping of household waste in close proximity to coastal
areas and the ocean, with harmful effect on the marine system. In the absence of proper waste management system and sanitation systems, public health issues
arise as wastewater and solid waste discharges generate the spread of communicable diseases. In addition, improper disposal of waste directly contributes to air
pollution. Whereas the urban waste management system consists of a number of septic tanks to dispose of sewage in towns, in rural expanses households rely on pit
latrines. In consideration of the fact that a large concentration of solid waste emanates from large cities, as a priority, the focus will be upon improving the
urban waste management system.</p>
<p>##### Vulnerability of the Waste Sector<br />
The aggregate amount of urban solid waste disposed in landfill sites is estimated at 28.37 Gg per year36. In effect, the low levels of emissions of solid waste
in landfills is explained by lack of adequate waste collection and disposal methods in the country. Municipal solid waste and wastewater form main sources of GHG
emissions in the waste sector. The methods used for the disposal of solid waste are linked to aerobic decomposition, which produces low levels of emissions.
Still, in the Comoros, a mere 2% of the population predominantly situated in urban areas use toilets with a flush mechanism. Based on a study highlighted in the
Second National Communication, findings suggest that there is a lack of substantial disparities between urban and rural expanses, as over 79% of the population
continue to use traditional latrines for waste treatment and disposal. In Grande Comore, 60% of the population is dependent on uncovered water containers and 40%
of the population is reliant on coastal aquifers. Challenges in terms of access to clean water still persist. Deterioration in the quality of potable water as a
result of contamination from products of weathering and erosion, human and animal excrement, and other hazardous waste and chemicals, and other issues such as
chronic problems with water supply, as well as high costs to access water all contribute to the vulnerabilities of the waste sector.</p>
<p>##### Exposure to Climate Impacts and Risks
In the Comoros, pollution from waste, which is diversified and large in quantity, is principally concentrated in large cities along the coast. Due to high
reliance on imports, most of the waste that is identified consists of mainly imported and non-biodegradable products such as plastic, glass and metal37. When
waste is incorrectly disposed, blocked drainage systems and stream flows can generate flood disasters. Major risks of pollution are further aggravated in the
open sea by large oil tankers. Whereas, illegal waste dumping can trigger the spread of infectious diseases and vermin, as well as increase the risk of
contamination of groundwater reservoirs and coral degradation38. Waste incineration is also a contributor to GHG emissions for its role in the release of dioxins
and furans into the atmosphere. Improper treatment and disposal of wastes that go unchecked result in contamination of waterbodies, which cause biodiversity loss
due to chemicals and harmful toxins that destroy terrestrial or marine fauna and flora. In the absence of solid waste management, waste such as sewage sludge,
special waste and leachate can pollute waterbodies with irreparable harm.</p>
